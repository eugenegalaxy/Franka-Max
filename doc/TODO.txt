Here is an approximate plan of what should be done as a first step towards Franka Max:
DONE | 1. Define all objects on the workspace and place/mark them (Assume position is fixed)
DONE | 2. Create a task in WEB API to pick up part and deliver it to a specific place in air, wait for user confirmation, release
DONE | 3. In python, write a script that releases brakes, goes to home pos, starts task above.
DONE | 4. Create all needed pick/place tasks (4-5 in total?)
DONE | 5. In Python, add those 4-5 tasks and make a menu what to do 
DONE | 6. Add various intentinputs from slides and randomize what is asked.
DONE | 7. Make a full sequence of assembly

8. Research on stop/resume motions.
9. Figure out how to get C++ function of StatusCheck into Python and use it. 
    9.1 Imlement StatusCheck into every task to WAIT for previous task to finish before starting current one.
10. Make a sequence where there is a break between each object-fetching (for questions/verbal explanations)
DONE | 11. Make a sequence to assemble a case ONLY with a robot, no human hands.
12. Document work/README
